YOU NEED FIREFOX, and also download gecko driver from this repo

To make this work you need to install python, then write in cmd "python", "pip install selenium", close the cmd, open main.py with notepad and change firefox and geckodriver paths to where they're located, to copy a file's path you need to hold shift, right click on the file and select "copy as path".
