YOU NEED FIREFOX, and gecko driver (from here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.29.1/geckodriver-v0.29.1-win64.zip)

To make this work you need to install python, write in cmd "python", "pip install selenium", then close the cmd, open the file with notepad and change firefox and geckodriver paths to where they're located, to do so you simply need to hold shift, right click on a file and select "copy as path".
